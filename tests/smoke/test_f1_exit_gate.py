"""F1 exit-gate smoke test.

Runs the real deepdive on AAPL with all three personas. Requires
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY in the environment. Marked ``integration`` so it does
not run in the default test loop.

Verifies the four exit-gate clauses from §7 F1 of the program design:
1. Three persona runs launched.
2. Per-analyst markdown is written to data/runs/<run_id>/.
3. Both ``runs`` and ``briefs`` rows are recorded in SQLite.
4. The produced brief contains the three structured sections.
