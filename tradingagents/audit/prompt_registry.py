"""Versioned prompt template registry (T1.4).

Why this exists
---------------
Pre-T1.4 every agent factory carried its prompt as an inline f-string.
Editing a prompt — even fixing a typo — silently changed the
behaviour of every future run, while existing trace files still
recorded the old rendered text. There was no way to look at a trace
six months later and answer "which prompt version produced this?"
beyond "git blame the file at that commit".

T1.4 fixes this by:

1. Moving every prompt body into a file under :data:`PROMPTS_DIR`,
   named ``{key}.{version}.txt``.
2. Hashing the **template** (not the rendered text) with SHA-256.
3. Letting each render() return both the substituted string AND the
   template hash, so agents can attach it to LangChain's callback
   metadata and TraceCallback (T1.2) writes it into the trace
   record's payload.

Combined with T1.3's hash chain, this means: for any historical run
you can recover (a) the exact text the LLM saw [T1.2], (b) the
template that produced it [T1.4], and (c) cryptographic proof that
neither has been edited since [T1.3]. That's the full
reproducibility floor SR 11-7 model validation requires.

Versioning convention
---------------------
Prompts are immutable after deployment. To revise:

- Add ``researchers/bull_researcher.v2.txt`` alongside the existing
  ``v1.txt``. Both stay on disk forever.
- Bump the version in ``default_config['prompt_versions']`` or pass
  ``version=...`` explicitly at the call site.
- Old traces continue to be replayable against ``v1`` because the
  file is still there. New traces use ``v2``.

The ``v{N}`` integer naming is arbitrary; the registry treats version
as an opaque string. ``v1``, ``v2-rc1``, ``v3-2026-01-15-typofix``
all work.

Template syntax
---------------
We use :class:`string.Template` (``$var`` and ``${var}``) rather than
f-strings or Jinja2 for three reasons:

1. **No new dependency** — Jinja2 is heavy and we don't need its
   features (loops, conditionals).
2. **Safer** — ``string.Template.substitute`` raises on missing
   variables. Jinja2 silently substitutes empty strings, which would
   produce ambiguous prompts on a typo at the call site.
3. **Hash-stable** — substitution is purely textual; no implicit
   formatting like Python's f-string ``{x!r}`` that could change
   output if a Python version updates the repr of some type.

Variables that appear in the f-string as ``{market_report}`` become
``${market_report}`` in the template.
