"""Trace record schema (T1.1).

Every callback event in the audit stream produces one ``TraceRecord``.
The schema is intentionally narrow: anything that varies per event type
(messages list, tool input, etc.) lives under the loosely-typed
``payload`` dict so adding a new event type doesn't require schema
migration. What's locked is the spine — id, session, parent, type,
timestamp, and the content-addressed hash of the payload.

The fields exist for these reasons:
- ``record_id`` / ``parent_record_id`` reconstruct the call tree
  (tool calls inside a chain inside a graph node) without relying on
  file ordering, which append-only streams can't guarantee under
  concurrent writers.
- ``session_id`` groups all records from one ``TraceCallback`` instance
  so a CLI session = one logical file even if multiple were emitted.
- ``payload_hash`` is the cryptographic anchor T1.3's hash chain will
  link against. We compute it now so the on-disk format is ready for
  the chain when it ships, no migration needed.
- ``prev_hash`` is reserved for T1.3 and recorded as empty string in
  Phase 1 — a string rather than None to keep canonical JSON shape
  stable across phases.
